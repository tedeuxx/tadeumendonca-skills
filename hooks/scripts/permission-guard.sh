# permission-guard.sh — PreToolUse(Bash) guard shipped by tadeumendonca-skills.
#
# Enforces the model-agnostic, IRREVERSIBLE "floor" centrally, so every consuming
# repo inherits the same protection without re-declaring it. This is defense in
# depth: it only blocks operations that are dangerous in ANY repo regardless of
# its branch model (the danger is irreversibility that escapes git, not "which
# branch"). Branch/prod-promotion boundaries (e.g. push/merge to a protected
# branch) are repo-specific and live in each repo's .claude/settings.json `deny`
# — that is the hard backstop. Deliberately does NOT block by branch context, so
# it is safe for both GitFlow (main=prod) and trunk-based (main=working) repos.
#
# Contract: receives the PreToolUse JSON on stdin; denies by printing a
# permissionDecision JSON and exiting 0. Fails OPEN (allows) on any parse error,
# because settings.json `deny` is the authoritative backstop and we never want to
# wedge the agent on a malformed payload.
