# Tests that every INVENTORY COUNT published in README.md and CLAUDE.md matches what the repo
# actually contains.
#
# Why this exists: the README is the surface a forker meets first, and its pitch is concrete —
# "19 subagent personas", "73 skills", and a per-directory breakdown. Concreteness is the point;
# it is also the thing that rots. Adding one skill falsifies four numbers across two files, and
# nothing about adding a skill makes anyone open the README. A wrong count on the front door of a
# repo whose whole claim is "the code is the pitch" is worse than no count, because it is checkable
# and it fails the check.
#
# The alternative was to publish no numbers. That was rejected: vagueness is not accuracy, it is
# just unfalsifiable. This makes the claim cheap to keep true instead.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, said plainly so the green is not read as more than it is: it asserts the
# numbers, never the prose around them. A README describing the wrong thing in the right quantity
# passes this suite.
