#!/usr/bin/env bash
# funnel-review.sh — the ANALYSIS half of the content-funnel rite (#401).
#
# ── WHAT IT IS, AND THE ONE SENTENCE IT MUST NOT BE READ PAST ────────────────────────────────────
#
# It is a REPORT WRITER over a committed collection file. It reads no network, holds no credential,
# and reaches no external surface — every figure it prints was put in the collection file by a human
# or by a driver reading the owner's own already-authenticated browser. It returns no verdict, it
# gates nothing, and every exit path but a caller error is success.
#
# THIS IS NOT A HOOK AND IS NOT IN `hooks/scripts/` FOR A REASON — the same reason
# `scripts/milestone-create.sh` states in its own header: nothing registers it in `hooks/hooks.json`,
# and any `*.sh` under `hooks/scripts/` declaring a `# purpose:` line is read by the inventory gate as
# a mechanism that must be registered, so an unregistered script there is either an orphan (red) or a
# mechanism pretending not to be one.
#
# ── THE DISTINCTION THIS FILE EXISTS FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The rite's collection route is the owner's authenticated Chrome (owner ruling, 2026-09-10:
# «hoje o chrome do host esta autenticado. o claude in chrome consegue acessar.»). So the rite is
# CONDITIONALLY collectable: with no authenticated browser it reads nothing. A rite that quietly does
# nothing is indistinguishable from a rite that ran and found nothing — this repository's own named
# worst shape — so the two states print DIFFERENT LITERALS at column 0:
#
#   FUNNEL-REVIEW-NOT-COLLECTED   nothing was read. There is no findings section at all.
#   FUNNEL-REVIEW-RAN             the surfaces were read. The findings section exists, and may say it
#                                 is empty — an empty section that says so is a result.
#
# Neither literal is a substring of the other, so a grep for one cannot be satisfied by the other.
#
# ── WHAT IT CANNOT DO, SAID BEFORE ANY GREEN IS READ ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   * It cannot tell a TRUE collection file from a plausible one. `collected: yes` is an assertion by
#     whoever wrote the file; nothing here verifies that a browser was ever opened. A driver that
#     invented its figures produces a byte-identical run to one that read them.
#   * It cannot fire. Nothing dispatches this rite — see `commands/funnel-review.md`'s own last
#     section. `hooks/scripts/cadence-notice.sh` NOTICES that the artifact is stale; noticing is not
#     firing, and a hook cannot dispatch.
#   * It cannot count findings in prose. The cap below is printed into the report; the arm that
#     enforces it reads the LANDED artifact (`scripts/funnel-review.test.sh`), so a run that never
#     wrote a file is invisible to it.
#
# Contract: prints the report body on stdout, exits 0. Exits 2 only on a caller error (no period).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/funnel-review.sh <period> [--root <dir>]

set -uo pipefail

# The cap, as a NUMBER, the way `commands/sprint-retrospective.md` caps a persona at two. Two and not
# three: the prototype session produced three tracked items from one sitting, and a rite producing
# three items per period is a machine for generating work — which is the failure this loop names
# first. The cap is the ceiling, never a quota.
MAX_FINDINGS=2

# The consent ceiling rides with EVERY figure rather than being stated once under the table. A clause
# stated once is read once; a reader quoting a single line out of this report into a slide takes the
# number and leaves the bound behind.
#
# IT IS SURFACE-AWARE, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE NARROWING OF #401's CRITERION 7 RATHER THAN A MISS.
# The criterion says every figure carries "the consent-ceiling clause". Pasting the site's clause onto
# a platform-reported figure would be FALSE: the consent banner gates this site's analytics and gates
# nothing on LinkedIn. So the literal `consent-ceiling:` is on every figure — the criterion's
# checkable half — and its TEXT states the bound that actually applies to that surface. A true clause
# on the wrong surface is a false bound wearing the right word, which is worse than a missing one
# because it reads as having been thought about.
