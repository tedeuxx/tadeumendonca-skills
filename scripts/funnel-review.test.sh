# funnel-review.test.sh — does the analysis half distinguish NOT-COLLECTED from RAN, refuse to print
# a figure without its sample size, stay inside the cap, reach no network, and get named by the
# cadence carrier?
#
# Mutation-checked: every assertion below was verified to fail against a deliberately broken version
# of `scripts/funnel-review.sh` — not of this file — because an assertion that cannot fail is worse
# than none, and editing the checker only proves the checker responds to being edited. The mutations
# and the reds they produced are recorded in the pull request rather than here, where they would go
# stale.
#
# THE NETWORK TOOLS ARE STUBBED TO A RECORDER RATHER THAN REMOVED, deliberately — the same technique
# `hooks/scripts/cadence-notice.test.sh` uses and for the same reason. Removing `curl` and `gh` from
# PATH would make "the analysis half reaches no network" pass vacuously, which is the shape of a check
# whose pattern is dead. The recorder appends every invocation to a file, so the assertion reads a
# file that CAN be non-empty, and one case proves it can by invoking a stub directly.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE CANNOT ASSERT, said here so no green is over-read:
#   * that a collection file is TRUE. `collected: yes` is an assertion by whoever wrote it; a driver
#     that invented its figures produces a byte-identical run to one that read them.
#   * that the rite RAN. Nothing observes a dispatch. The cap arm reads the LANDED artifacts, so a
#     period that was never reported is indistinguishable here from one that produced no findings.
#   * that the cadence line means the rite happens. The carrier NOTICES; it cannot dispatch.
